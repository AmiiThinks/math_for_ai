            </div>

            <p class="lead">
                The Math for AI seminars are a series of talks primarily given by the students and faculty studying Artificial Intelligence at the University of Alberta, but everyone is welcome to attend! The talks are held biweekly on Wednesdays in <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/contact-us/csc-floorplans">CSC 3-33</a>.  See the <a href="#schedule">schedule below</a> for specific dates, times, and the topics that are planned so far.
            </p>

            <p>The goal of the seminars is to build the mathematical toolbox, collaboratively.  Our lab is of a diverse academic background, so it's likely many individuals are an expert in some topic that many others could use.  This seminar series is a platform for those experts to share their tools.  Hence, the seminar topics should focus on mathematics. The speakers need not connect their ideas to Artificial Intelligence, though they can if they wish.</p>

            <p>
                If you're interested in giving a talk, then email <a href="mailto:ysatsang@ualberta.ca">Yash</a> or <a href="mailto:kdbanman@ualberta.ca">Kirby</a>.  It's helpful to read the <a href="#guidelines">guidelines for presenters</a> as well!

        <p>
            If you're interested in presenting, here are a few things to keep in mind:

            <ul>
              <li>Each talk should cover a mathematical tool or process useful (in your view) to AI researchers.</li>
              <li>You are not obligated to connect the ideas to AI, but you are encouraged to if the connection is not obvious.</li>
              <li>It's highly recommended, though not essential, that you recommend resources that further explore your topic.</li>
              <li>You may use slides, whiteboard, or both.</li>
              <li>A description needs to be written up at least one week prior and sent to <a href="mailto:ysatsang@ualberta.ca">Yash</a> or <a href="mailto:kdbanman@ualberta.ca">Kirby</a>.</li>
              <li>If desired, you can have an organizer introduce you.</li>
              <li>Each talk should start within a soon after 2:00 pm, and last 30 minutes, leaving time for questions and discussion.</li>
              <li>It's your responsibility to make sure that you pass over any disruptive questions if they divert from the talk.</li>
              <li>If desired, a follow up survey will be sent to the audience, and the results will be made available to you.</li>
              <li>Talks are not recorded for publication or future viewing.</li>
            </ul>
